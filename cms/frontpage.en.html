<p>Welcome to the advent calendar of the <a href="https://ieee.uni-passau.de/">IEEE Student Branch Passau</a>! As with a
    real advent calendar, this one has 24 doors, that open one by one. However, this advent calendar does not contain
    any chocolate, but programming tasks! Until Christmas Eve, we publish a total of 24 problems, that you can solve
    until the end of the year.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tasks will be uploaded at 9am CET.</strong> Additionally you can find an overview of announced maintenance
    work and other changes <a href="/news">here</a>.
