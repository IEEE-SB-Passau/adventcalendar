        <ul>
            <li>Everybody is welcome to participate in this advent calendar. It is not required to to be student at the university of Passau.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li>Problems:
        <ul>
            <li>Between 2017-12-01 and 2017-12-24 every day at 09:00am (Passau local time) a new problem is published.</li>
            <li>These problems can be solved until the end of the year, that is until 2017-12-31.</li>
            <li>Each problem has public and private testcases.</li>
            <li>Public testcases are provided together with their problem. For private testcases you can only see if you passed the testcase, or not.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li>Submissions:
        <ul>
            <li>A submission consists of a file containing the sourcecode of your program. We compile that program and execute it on our evaluation system. The output of the program for the input of a testcase is then compared to the expected output. If they match, the testcase is considered passed.</li>
            <li>You can submit as many solutions as you want. It also doesn't matter if your first submission fails.</li>
            <li>Even if it might be tempting, it is forbidden to upload programs that might harm a fair and healthy competition. We reserve the right to exclude participants that violate this rule from the competition.</li>
            <li>Possible programming languages are C, Cobol, C++, C#, Fortran, Haskell, Java, JavaScript, Objective C, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Scala and more. Further information can be found in our <a href="/faq">FAQ</a>.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <br/>
    <li>Scoring:
        <ul>
            <li>Each solved testcase awards a specific amount of points. These points are accounted per testcase. So you can collect points even if your solution did not pass all testcases!</li>
            <li>The time of the submission does not influence the amount of points you will get. A solution submitted on the first the problem is available is as good as a solution submitted a week later.</li>
            <li>The points awarded for a problem are always taken from <strong>one</strong> solution: The points are taken from the submission that awards the most points.</li>
            <li>The total score is the sum of the points of the best submissions for each problem.</li>
        </ul></li>
    <br/>
    <li>Prices:
        <ul>
            <li>The participants with the highest score at the end of the competition will be invited to the price-giving.</li>
