# This Repository contains the front-end Web application for IEEE-Adventskalender.

## Installation 

* Download sbt and start it in the root of this repository to run the application
* Connect to evaluation service via the heartbeat/eval deamon from [https://github.com/IEEE-SB-Passau/adventcalendar-evaluation](https://github.com/IEEE-SB-Passau/adventcalendar-evaluation). This deamon is currently not available to the public since the codebase needs some serious cleanup. If you are interested in helping us, please create an issue. 
* Open webbrowser and use the app.
